# Hello there.

I enjoy working on understanding the fundamentals of AI:
   - Reinforcement learning
   - Bayesian reasoning and statistics

Some recent projects are:
  - Implementing Gaussian process based hyper parameter optimization using expected improvement as the aquisition function. [Link](https://github.com/sachag678/100DaysofCode/blob/master/algorithms/bayesianOptimizer.py)
  - Implementing the standard line search and trust region search methods for optimization: [Link](https://github.com/sachag678/optimization)
