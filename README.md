# Hello there.

I enjoy working on understanding the fundamentals of AI:
   - Reinforcement learning
   - Bayesian reasoning and statistics

Some recent projects are:
  - Implementing Gaussian process based hyper parameter optimization using expected improvement as the aquisition function.
  - Implementing the standard line search and trust region search methods for optimization.
