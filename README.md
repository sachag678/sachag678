I am a data scientist who enjoys all things anaytics, visualizations and predictive modelling. I also enjoy delving deeply into things like RL and optimization algorithms. 

Some recent projects are:
  - Designing custom anaytics dashboard to track the prices of used iphones on kijiji to find the best deal: [Link](https://github.com/sachag678/iphone-tracker)
  - Implementing a visualization tool to understand the standard line search and trust region search methods for optimization: [Link](https://github.com/sachag678/optimization)
